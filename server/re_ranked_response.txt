Query: How do I search for people given their current title, current company and location?
Response: To search for people given their current title, current company, and location, you can use the People Profile Enrichment API. Here are the key points to consider:

* Use the `current_title` parameter to specify the current title of the person.
* Use the `current_company` parameter to specify the current company of the person.
* Use the `location` parameter to specify the location of the person.
* Include the `auth_token` in the header for authorization.

Example Request:
```
curl 'https://api.crustdata.com/enrichment/people?current_title=Software+Engineer&current_company=Microsoft&location=New+York' \
  --header 'Authorization: Token $auth_token' \
  --header 'Accept: application/json'
```
Note: Replace `$auth_token` with your actual authentication token.

Also, you can use other parameters such as `page` and `per_page` to control pagination, and `fields` to specify the fields you want to retrieve in the response.

Please refer to the API documentation for the full list of available parameters and their usage.

Query: How can I use the Company Data Enrichment API to fetch data for multiple companies by their domains?
Response: To fetch data for multiple companies using the Company Data Enrichment API, follow these steps:

* Use the `company_domain` parameter with a comma-separated list of up to 25 domains.
* Include the `auth_token` in the header for authorization.
* Optionally, specify the fields to be returned using the `fields` parameter.

Example Request:
```
curl 'https://api.crustdata.com/screener/company?company_domain=example.com,other.com,another.com' \
  --header 'Authorization: Token $auth_token' \
  --header 'Accept: application/json'
```
Default fields in the response include top-level company data unless specified using the `fields` parameter.

Note: The `company_domain` parameter accepts a maximum of 25 domains per request. Exceeding this limit may result in an error.

Query: What error will I get if I request unauthorized fields in an API response?
Response: When requesting unauthorized fields in an API response, you will receive a `403 Forbidden` error. This error indicates that the server understands the request but refuses to authorize it.

Specifically, the error response will contain a JSON object with the following structure:
```json
{
  "error": {
    "code": 403,
    "message": "Forbidden"
  }
}
```
This error occurs when you attempt to access fields that are not included in your authorized scope or when you don't have the necessary permissions to access certain fields.
